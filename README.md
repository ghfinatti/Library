### Lib-it project

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

Lib-it is a virtual library where you can store your books in the web, using localStorage. Add your books using the left-side form and they'll be stored locally. This project allowed me to learn and practice object constructors.

You can see it live [here](https://ghfinatti.github.io/library/).
